# UTF-8String.h
UTF-8_String.h - Is a header you can drop in your project to have access to a collection vector safe structures that can do many things like convert from any type of char used to create a cross platform C++ programmer's UTF-8 tool kit. 

Found in the UTF-8_String.h File using namespace iBS
        List of varable types:
            iBS::u8char, iBS::u8str, iBS::u8text
        They are: 
            compatable with char, wchar_t, std::string, and Unicodes.
            vector safe structures.
            Self Cleaning.

# Unicode 64bit int API

Unicode_String.h - Is like the above header, but the structures charT are saved in memory as a single Unicode 64 bit Int.

Found in the Unicode_String.h File using namespace iBS
        List of varable types:
        iBS::Uchar,        iBS::Ustr,        iBS::Utext

        They are: 
            compatable with iBS::u8char, iBS::u8str, iBS::u8text
            vector safe structures.
            Self Cleaning.

iBS_Matrix.h - An int based matrix stuct of vectors. 

Found in the iBS_Matrix.h File using namespace iBS
        varable type: iBS::Matrix
           The varables are mathmatically correct with operator +,-,*,^
